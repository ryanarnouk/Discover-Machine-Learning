      "description": "<p>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning that uses a system of reward and punishments. A reinforcement learning algorithm otherwise known as an agent, learns by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards by performing actions correctly and it gets penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. That way you can train the computer to do something all on its own. </p>",
