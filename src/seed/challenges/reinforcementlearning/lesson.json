      "description": "Wonder how that not-hotdog predictor works? It works by taking thousands of images of hotdogs and a mathematical algorithm that lets the computer learn what a hotdog looks like. This way, it can detect if there is a hotdog in the image based on the images fed to it. It took ______ images to train the predictor and it can get better the more it is used as more images are fed into the algorithm. Traditionally, if we wanted to build something to recognize a hotdog we would have to put the details of a hotdog and tell the computer every little detail, such as the colours, the shapes, etc. With machine learning the computer can learn from images instead of telling it exactly what a hotdog looks like. Similar to how us humans learn from our surroundings. In this course we learn more about these algorithms and make our own!",

      "description": "<div><p>The first algorithm we are going to take a look at is Linear Regression. We can use linear regression to predict prices. PUT IMAGE Linear regression plots a line through number data points, that way to you can plot a line through data points that represent 2 parameters. For example, making a house price predictor you can plot a line through data that represents square feet and the actual price. That way we can input square feet and get a prediction on the price. Linear regression is supervised learning because the data is labeled.</p></div>",
