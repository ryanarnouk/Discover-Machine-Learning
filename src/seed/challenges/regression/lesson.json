      "description": "Machine learning is the idea that computers learn based on data. Data is information, whether it is about images, house prices, medical information, etc. Data is all around us, and it can be used for Machine Learning. Mathematical algorithms are used to make a machine predict things based on that information. Data is fed into the computer and the computer learns from the data and it gets better the more data is fed into the algorithm. Before machine learning, computers were directly programmed to do specific things.",

For example, the plate is white, it has six characters and it has curves on 4 corners. As you can see, this can be very inconvenient because there are so many different type of license plates. Instead, we can use an algorithm and give the computer images of license plates so that it can learn what a licence plate looks like.",

That means that the algorithm is presented with uncategorised data that is unlabel and the algorithm needs to come up with patterns found in the data to classify them with each other. Unsupervised learning is can be unpredictable.</p><h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforcement learning has no data. Instead, it is a type of programming that trains algorithms with rewards and punishments. A reinforcement learning algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and it receives awards for good moves and gets penalties for performing a bad move. The algorithm can learn completely by itself.</p>"

Linear regression plots a line through numerical data points, that way you can plot a line through all the data points to get the average. For example, you can create an algorithm that predicts the price of a house and you can plot a line through that data using linear regression. With that average line bringing together the square feet and the price of a house we can input any square feet value and with that line that we the computer created we can get an approximate prediction of the price of the house based on our set of data.",
