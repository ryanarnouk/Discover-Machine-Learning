      "description": "Machine learning is this idea that computers learn based on data. Data is information, whether that is information about images, house prices, medical information, etc. Data is all around us, and it can be used for Machine Learning.  Algorithms based on math are used to make a machine predict things based on that information. Data is fed into the computer and the computer learns from the data and it gets better the more data is fed into the algorithm. Before machine learning, computers to be explicitly programmed to do specific things. There is 3 types of machine learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. ",

      "description": "Let's say we want to program a computer to detect license plates. Before machine learning, we would have to program each part of the license plate. For example, the plate is white, it has six characters, it has curves on 4 corners. As you can see, this can be very inconvenient especially since there are so many different type of license plates. Instead, we can use an algorithm and give the computer images of licenses so that it can learn what a licence plate looks like.",

Inputs and output data are labelled for classification.</p><h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2><p>Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning has unlabeled data. That means that the algorithm is presented with uncategorised data that is unlabel and the algorithm needs to come up with patterns found in the data to classify them with each other. Unsupervised learning is can be unpredictable.</p><h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>Reinforcement learning has no data. Instead, it is a type of programming that trains algorithms with rewards and punishments. A reinforcement learning algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and it recieves awards for good moves and gets penalties for preforming a bad move. The algorithm can learn completely by itself.</p>"

PUT IMAGE Linear regression plots a line through number data points, that way to you can plot a line through data points that represent 2 parameters. For example, making a house price predictor you can plot a line through data that represents square feet and the actual price. That way we can input square feet and get a prediction on the price. Linear regression is supervised learning because the data is labeled. First thing we want to do is add an import function WORK ON IMPORT FUNCTION INSTRUCTIONS AND ADD IMAGES</p></div>",
